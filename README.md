# Tower-of-Hanoi-9-disks
A puzzle game usually available with 3 disks, I have implemented an extended version of that game. It consists of 9 disks and 3 rod-bars.
There are some rules & regulations for playing this game. Larger disk cannot be placed over a smaller disk. Also, there is a time limit for playing this game. Winning condition requires all the 9 disks on the last rod and in proper sorted order.
